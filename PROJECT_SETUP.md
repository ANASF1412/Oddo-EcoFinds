# EcoFinds Development Setup Guide

## The Challenge
This project needs MySQL but we want to keep it shareable and not tied to personal passwords.

## Solution: Development User Setup

### Option 1: Using Your MySQL Workbench (Recommended)

Since you have MySQL Workbench with your personal credentials:

1. **Open MySQL Workbench**
2. **Connect using your personal password**
3. **Copy and paste this SQL script:**

```sql
-- Create the project database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS oddo;

-- Create development user (no password needed)
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'dev_user'@'localhost';

-- Grant permissions to the development user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON oddo.* TO 'dev_user'@'localhost';

-- Apply changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Verify setup
SELECT 'Setup complete!' as Status;
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user WHERE User = 'dev_user';
```

4. **Run the script** (press Ctrl+Shift+Enter)

### Option 2: Alternative Configuration

If you prefer to keep using root but want the project shareable:

1. **Update .env for your environment:**
```env
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
```

2. **Add .env to .gitignore** (already done)

3. **Document in README** that users need to configure their own .env

### Option 3: Docker Solution (Advanced)

We could containerize MySQL with Docker for consistent setup across environments.

## After Database Setup

Once you've run the SQL script:

1. **Test connection:**
```bash
mysql -u dev_user -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```

2. **Start the application:**
```bash
npm start
```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost:3000/api/health
